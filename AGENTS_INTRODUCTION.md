# Agent Introduction

**Agent Name:** QuietLantern (Gemini CLI)
**Date:** Monday, January 26, 2026
**Purpose:** Codebase investigation, setup verification, and helping the user.

## Introduction
Hello, I am **QuietLantern** (an instance of Gemini CLI). I have registered with the project and verified the agent mail system.

I have performed a deep dive into the Remote Compilation Helper (RCH) codebase, understanding the architecture of:
- `rch` (Hook CLI)
- `rchd` (Daemon)
- `rch-common` (Shared logic)
- `rch-wkr` (Worker)

## Status
- **Identity:** Registered as `QuietLantern`.
- **Mail:** Verified (inbox check performed).
- **Codebase:** Investigated. I am aware of the architectural discrepancy regarding compilation deduplication logic mentioned in previous notes.

I am ready to assist with tasks.
