    after_help = r#"EXAMPLES:
    # Quick start - install hook and start daemon
    rch hook install && rch daemon start

    # Check system status
    rch status --workers --jobs

    # Probe worker connectivity
    rch workers probe --all

    # Show where config values come from
    rch config show --sources

    rch hook test

    # Generate shell completions
    rch completions bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/rch

HOOK MODE:
    When invoked without arguments, RCH acts as a PreToolUse hook for Claude Code.
    It reads JSON from stdin, decides whether to intercept the command, and writes
    JSON to stdout. This is automatic when installed via 'rch hook install'.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
    RCH_PROFILE           Profile to use: dev, prod, test (sets defaults below)
    RCH_LOG_LEVEL         Logging level: trace, debug, info, warn, error, off
    RCH_LOG_FORMAT        Log format: pretty, json, compact
    RCH_DAEMON_SOCKET     Path to daemon Unix socket
    RCH_DAEMON_TIMEOUT_MS Timeout for daemon communication (default: 5000)
    RCH_SSH_KEY           Path to SSH private key for worker connections
    RCH_TRANSFER_ZSTD_LEVEL  Compression level 1-22 (default: 3)
    RCH_VISIBILITY        Hook output visibility: none, summary, verbose
    RCH_VERBOSE           Convenience: sets visibility=verbose when true
    RCH_QUIET             Force visibility=none when true
    RCH_MOCK_SSH          Enable mock SSH for testing (set to 1)
    RCH_TEST_MODE         Enable test mode (set to 1)
    RCH_ENABLE_METRICS    Enable metrics collection (set to true)

CONFIG PRECEDENCE (highest to lowest):
    1. Command-line arguments
    2. Environment variables
    3. Profile defaults (RCH_PROFILE)
    4. .env / .rch.env files
    5. Project config (.rch/config.toml)
    6. User config (~/.config/rch/config.toml)
    7. Built-in defaults
